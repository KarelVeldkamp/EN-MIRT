# rgmirt
An adaptation of the R-package [mirt](https://github.com/philchalmers/mirt), that allows for l1 and l2 regularisation of the likelihood. This is useful for sparse data applications. Most code is simply copied from the original repo, with the additional option of adding a penalty to the likelihood.
